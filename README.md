This is a test
Yes...Yes it is.
Add images by putting in this code <img class="pic" src=" file:///C:/Users/khale/Documents/Rubber_ducks/The-Rubber-Ducks/images/Logo_1_blackoutline.png">      and change size in css by calling its class name in this case "pic"

for the pngs in our images folder, click the file and drag the file from the top of the page(not the side bar) and drag into chrome. then pull the link from the url box in chrome and input in place of src="here"

Make sure everything is connected properly!!!!!

for help on grids here is a link   https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp
this website looks easy to follow and shouldn't give you a hard time. I'm not the best with grids so I cant explain it the best. You have to use css with html though.


stay on task, communicate with one another and reach specific goals and I will see you all tomorrow
