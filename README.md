This is a test
Yes...Yes it is.
Add images by putting in this code <img class="pic" src=" file:///C:/Users/khale/Documents/Rubber_ducks/The-Rubber-Ducks/images/Logo_1_blackoutline.png">      and change size in css by calling its class name in this case "pic"

for the pngs in our images folder, click the file and drag the file from the top of the page(not the side bar) and drag into chrome. then pull the link from the url box in chrome and input in place of src="here"
